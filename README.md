Service-vs-Factory
==================

A simple app to demonstrate the similarities and difference of each


This is a project through which I wanted to showcase the similarity and differences of Service and Factories.Many a times, factories and services appear to be so similar that we do not understand it ,or we dont know when to use it.
This project primarily answers the following questions

  - What is the similarity ?

  - What is the difference ?

  - How can I use Service and factory both to acheive end result ?

  - In what cases can only service be used or only factory be used.
